## 1. The Problem

The differentiation of human Pluripotent Stem Cells (hPSC) into Retinal Pigmented Epithelium (RPE) is a promising field for treating blindness. However, manually monitoring this process under a microscope—by segmenting, counting, and classifying cells—is extremely slow, subjective, and a major bottleneck for research.

## 2. My Solution

To solve this, I am developing a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture, to create a system that can automatically and accurately analyze these microscope images.

The model is being trained to:
1.  **Segment:** Identify and outline the precise shape of each cell.
2.  **Classify:** Determine if the cell has successfully differentiated into an RPE cell.
3.  **Count:** Provide an accurate count of differentiated vs. undifferentiated cells.

## 3. My Role & Key Contributions

I am the **Sole Researcher and Developer** for this project.

* **Current Status:**
    * Researched and authored the complete 60-page **Seminar Proposal** (see PDF) detailing the state-of-the-art, methodology, and proposed model architecture.
    * Developed the initial Python code for data loading, preprocessing, and model building (see `.ipynb`).
    * Currently in the process of training, tuning, and validating the ViT model.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * All research, data processing, model development, and analysis.

## 4. Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** `Python`
* **Software & Libraries:** `Jupyter Notebook`, `Google Colab`, `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `OpenCV`
* **Model:** `Vision Transformer (ViT)`

## 5. Project Status

**Status: [Ongoing]**
*This project is in active development as my final-year undergraduate thesis. The proposal has been approved, and model training is underway.*
